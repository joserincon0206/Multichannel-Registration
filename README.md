# Multichannel-Registration
Registration of multimodality cameras is very useful for detecting and tracking objects as you can have complementary information with different sensors. I am demonstrating that it is possible to perfectly align images from different sensors: depth, RGB, 850nm, 970 nm, etc.

The Final Algorithm can be seen in ImageRegistrationFinal.gif

The Steps for this process are: 

1. Camera Calibration
2. Image registration using PointCloud
